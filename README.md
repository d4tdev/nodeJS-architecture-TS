## The project involves research on AWS, Docker, RabbitMQ ... and Clean Architecture

A use case of Clean Architecture in Node.js comprising of Express.js, MongoDB
and Redis as the main (but replaceable) infrastructure.

### Overview project

This example is a simple RESTful API application about eCommerce, by using the
_Clean Architecture_.

The objective of _Clean Architecture_ by [Robert C. Martin] is the separation of
concerns in software.
This separation is achieved by dividing the software into layers. Each layer is
encapsulated by a higher level layer and the way to communicate between the
layers is with the _Dependency Rule_.
